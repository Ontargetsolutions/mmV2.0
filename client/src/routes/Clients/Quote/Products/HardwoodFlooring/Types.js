                          Mosaic (Versailles) parquet is a classic type of
                          parquet panel consisting of a weave pattern framed in
                          a square. Mosaic parquet is associated with Versailles
                          Palace, since it was originally designed to replace
                          all marble floors in the palace in 1693. Elegant and
                          stylish wooden floors were painted by Louis IV, and
                          Versailles parquet has since become a symbol of royal
                          taste.

                        <p>
                          This unique parquet design has become the beginning of
                          classic parquet flooring and a global trend in Europe.
                          Its simplicity and grandeur are reflected in many
                          European castles, where the principle of symmetry was
                          combined with the laconic and solemn interior
                          decoration of the palace.
